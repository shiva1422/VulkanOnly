Perf:


The currently available drivers will only allow you to create a small number of queues for each queue family
 and you don't really need more than one. That's because you can create all of the command buffers
 on multiple threads and then submit them all at once on the main thread with a single low-overhead call.

for queuefamilies
 you could add logic to explicitly prefer a physical device that supports drawing and presentation in the same queue for improved performance.



 //TODO

 If you are only interested in depth values then you can disable the fragment shader stage, which is useful for shadow map generation.
